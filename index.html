<p>Ahoi hoi there and welcome to my website. My name is Peer and I’m currently a self-employed freelancer/contractor and research affiliate in cognitive and computational (auditory) neuroscience & Artificial Intelligence, partly affiliated  with the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/">Montréal Neurological Institute &amp; Hospital (MNI)</a> located at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>, with the <a href="https://www.brams.org/en/">International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS)</a> which is jointly run by the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> &amp; the <a href="https://sensein.group/">Senseable Intelligence Group</a> at the <a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/">McGovern Institute for Brain Research</a>. Additionally, I’m part of the <a href="https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">BIDS</a>, <a href="https://www.cneuromod.ca/">Neuromod</a> and <a href="https://www.repronim.org/">ReproNim</a> team.</p>

<p>In terms of research, I’m interested in generalization in biological and artificial agents and the potentially underlying transformations as a basis for intelligent adaptive behavior. I tackle these questions using MRI, EEG, behavior and artificial neural networks, with a special emphasis on data analysis approaches (e.g., pattern analyses, multimodal data integration, naturalistic paradigms, alignment methods & statistical learning) as open, transparent and reproducible as possible. Furthermore, I’m highly invested in education & outreach, fair access & utilization of knowledge, as well as responsible & sustainable science.</p>

<p>Do you have a challenging problem in the realm of neuroscience to tackle, including data acquisition, management, analyzses and reporting? You additionally would be interested in open & reproducible workflows, including standardization and version control? You are interested in workshops around data/project management, programming/computational environments, neuroimaging analyses via a diverse set of methods, including artificial intelligence? If so: Please don’t hesitate to contact me via one of the options outlined on the left and I’m more than happy to evaluate how I could be of help.</p>
