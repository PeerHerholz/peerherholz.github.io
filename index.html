  <h1 id="about">WELCOME</h1>
  <p>Ahoi hoi there and welcome to my website. My name is Peer and I'm currently a PhD student  </br>
  in cognitive and computational neuroscience partly affiliated with the <a href="http://www.lmn-marburg.de/index.php/de/" target="_blank">Laboratory for Multimodal Neuroimaging (LMN)</a> located at the
  <a href="https://www.uni-marburg.de/en" target="_blank">Philipps-University Marburg</a> & with the <a href="https://www.brams.org/en/" target="_blank">International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS)</a>
  which is jointly run by the <a href="http://www.umontreal.ca/en/" target="_blank">Université de Montréal</a> & <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">McGill University</a>. </br>
  </br>
  I'm  interested in how human and non-human brains, as well as machines process sounds, especially music, which I investigate using mainly fMRI and pattern analyses/computational approaches, more and more aided by EEG and behavior.  </br>

  <h1 id="about">ABOUT</h1>
  </br>
  <h2>aka a short BIO</h2>
  <p>After realizing that I should change my teenage musician slacker lifestyle to something good and productive
  I started my adventure into the human mind by earning a bachelor (University of Leipzig) and master (Phillips-University Marburg)
  degree in neurolinguistics and neuropsychology, followed by a master in cognitive & integrative systems neuroscience (Phillips-University Marburg). </br>
  </br>
  Throughout this time I was always puzzled by the same question: "are how waves transformed into sound and perceived by the human and non-human brain resulting
  in something incredibly powerful?", defining also my current PhD research interest and work investigating the neurobiology of music.
  Starting from simple tones and the structure of the auditory system to complex melodies and rhythms and
  the representation of music genres features, I'm interested in the influence of cortical development, as well as
  plasticity and how music related brain activation can be explained via computational and conceptual models.</br>
  </br>
  Starting in my masters I furthermore developed a major crush on everything related to analyses and methods within the realm
  of neuroinformatics, as well as open & reproducible (neuro)science. Most of the time I'm trying to combine all of the above organizing and conducting
  workshops, hackathons and lectures/talks, supvervising students and trying to establishing/pushing standards across different levels (institution, university, etc.)</br>

  <h2>music perception</h2>
  <p>As music is as divers as mysterious to such an extent that it's
    hard or nearly impossible to actually define it, I'm interested how music processing,
    especially perception, is shaped, how it can be described and possibly explained.
    To hopefully shed some light on this rather overwhelming question I investigate how
    human and non-human brains perceive and represent different music genres and how these
    representations can be explained based on auditory/music features, as well as conceptual
    and computational models. To do so I apply a broad range of methods, ranging from imaging
    (MRI & EEG) to behavior to artificial neural networks furthermore including important
    factors such as development (culture & music preference) and plasticity (musical training).
    You can find more information about this line of my research on the projects <a href="https://github.com/PeerHerholz/musicgenre_similarities" target="_blank">github</a> or <a href="https://osf.io/6e9vt/" target="_blank">OSF</a> page. </br>
    Furthermore, I'm working, as a remote contributor, in <a href="https://wvww.themusiclab.org" target="_blank">Harvard's music lab</a> in the amazing <a href="https://www.naturalhistoryofsong.org" target="_blank">Natinal History of Song</a> project
  </p>


  </br>
  <h2>sound processing</h2>
  <p>Our normal all day life is full of an ever changing and highly complex soundscape.
     How and during which time point during auditory perception those countless
     sound categories emerge in the cortical and subcortical auditory pathway is not only
     a very interesting, but also challenging question. For a quite a while I'm particulary
     fascinated by the cortical interaction of music, singing and language, which I investigate
     through combined MRI & EEG, anazlying subsequent data using different connectivity
     and machine learning approaches. Additionally, possible factors of influence such as musical
     training and handedness are an important part of this research question. The project's <a href="https://github.com/PeerHerholz/auditory_system_connectivities" target="_blank">github</a>
     and <a href="https://osf.io/uk82y/" target="_blank">OSF</a> pages provide more information.
  </p>


  </br>
  <h2>structure & function of the auditory cortex</h2>
  <p>Glasser at al. summarized it quite well in their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature18933" target="_blank">2016 "A Multi-modal Parcellation of Human Cerebral Cortex" paper</a>
    when they were stating "In contrast to early visual and somatomotor cortex, parcellation of the early
    auditory cortex has proven much more challenging..." (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18933" target="_blank">Suppl. 3, page 35, line 7-8</a> ).
    The robust and reliable localization and parcellation of the human auditory cortex, along with it's
    functional principles has been the subject of a long-standing debatte with the vast amount of possible analyses that
    to can be applied to the variety of possible measurements adding yet another layer of complexity. Based on that I started
    developing  <a href="https://github.com/PeerHerholz/ALPACA" target="_blank">ALPACA</a> (OSF page <a href="https://osf.io/w8h36/" target="_blank">here</a>), an open-source python toolbox for
    the "Automated Localization and Parcellation of Auditory Cortex Areas" (full disclosure: I had the abbreviation first and then
    tried to come up with a fitting name, luckily that worked out pretty well) which will include experiment and analyses scripts for
    different paradigms (natural sounds & classic tone bursts) and approaches (structural parcellation, mapping of auditory ROIs from
    atlases, fMRI, EEG, searchlights, encoding, etc.). The respective parts can be combined as preferred and run as functions or
    fully automated via docker as a BIDS app, hopefully helping folks with creating ROIs for their study and/or further advancing
    the investigation of the human auditory cortex.

  <h2>"disorders" of music processing</h2>
  <p>Given the importance and prominent role of music for the majortity of people out there, it's quite
     hard to imaging lacking the ability to actually process or enjoy music. However, for people affected
     by amusia or musical anhedonia this is reality. While the first have difficulties perceiving and/or producing
     melodies (pitch) or rhythms (or both) (if you're interested check this great <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2016.09.002 |" target="_blank">in depth and comprehensive review</a> by Isabelle Peretz),
     the latter show the incapacity of enjoying listening to music (great <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611211113 |" target="_blank">introduction, study and overview by Martínez-Molina et al.</a>).
     Interestingly, upon a closer look these two show some sort of "double dissociation" in that people affected by amusica can and do
     enjoy music despite the aforementioned problems, whereas people affected by musical anhedonia have no difficulties
     in processing music (e.g. it's structure). Hence, I'm very interested in both investigating possible models
     of explanation combining multimodal data with connectivity measures and multivariate approaches.
  </p>


  </br>
  <h2>tools for auditory neuroscience</h2>
  <p>Fellow folks working in auditory neuroscience know the somewhat struggle that
    goes along with that line of research, especially within the realm of MRI:
    due to the nature of the stimulus experiments can be harder to implement, take way longer
    SNR is far from being good and whatnot (make sure to check  <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2014.00253" target="_blank">Jonathan Peelle's amazing review on that topic</a>).
    Hence, working on how experiments can be improved
    is (like usual) as much as important as actually doing them. Besides the already mentioned
    <a href="https://github.com/PeerHerholz/ALPACA" target="_blank">ALPACA toolbox</a>, I'm therefore
    also very interested in improving settings for auditory neuroscience experiments. To this end,
    I'm e.g., working on MRI aqusition parameters and sequences (for example  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.08.025" target="_blank">ISSS</a> & <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.25408" target="_blank">multiband</a>)
    and a small toolbox that allows <a href="https://github.com/PeerHerholz/audiometry_mri" target="_blank">audiometry measurements in the MRI environment</a> (corresponding <a href="https://osf.io/vm64x/" target="_blank">OSF page</a>).
  </p>


  </br>
  <h2>neuroinformatics & methods</h2>
  <p>I was once told that one doesn't have to understand
    neuroscience methods and statistics in order to apply. While this is certainly true, it's
    also certainly bad. Starting with very little method & zero programming skills everything
    was kinda overwhelming but at the same time fascinating. The combination of math, physics,
    informatics and biology amazed me and the more I read and gained practical experience the more
    I wanted to understand. I'm especially insterested in data management and quality control, non-standard
    experimental setups (e.g., naturalistic stimulation) and acquisition schemes (e.g., multiband, MT),
    processing steps (e.g., ICA, detrending), image registration, multi-modal measurements & data integretation,
    as well as multivariate analyses approaches (e.g., machine learning, encoding models). Furthermore, I'm
    working on pipeline creation / automization and cloud / hpc computing, recently setting up my first
    own <a href="https://github.com/PeerHerholz/open_science_fellowship_project/blob/master/resources/neuroinformatics/server_specifications.md" target="_blank">server system</a>.
  </p>


  </br>
  <h2>open & reproducible (neuro)science</h2>
  <p>Starting with the lack of details in the methods section of papers I was reading to
     no chance of having a look at the data or code created some sort of frustration I found
     it hard to cope with. The abscence of the possibility to reproduce and/or create
     new results based on data and/or code combined with "behind closed curtains" practices and
     the "it's too precious" attitude certainly is far from the concept of science and concludes
     in distrust (please don't get me wrong, I don't want to preach and there's of course a gradient
     from "completely closed up" to "open by default").
