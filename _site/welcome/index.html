<p>Ahoi hoi there and welcome to my website. My name is Peer and I’m a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University and a research affiliate in cognitive and computational (auditory) neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analyses, partly affiliated with the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/">Montréal Neurological Institute &amp; Hospital (MNI)</a> located at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>, with the <a href="https://www.brams.org/en/">International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS)</a> which is jointly run by the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> &amp; <a href="https://sensein.group/">Senseable Intelligence Group</a> at the <a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/">McGovern Institute for Brain Research</a>. Additionally, I’m also part of the <a href="https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">BIDS</a>, <a href="https://www.cneuromod.ca/">Neuromod</a>, <a href="https://www.repronim.org/">ReproNim</a> teams and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-ai-alliance">European AI Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of research, I’m interested in generalization in biological and artificial agents and the potentially underlying transformations as a basis for intelligent adaptive behavior. I tackle these questions using MRI, EEG, behavior and artificial neural networks, with a special emphasis on data analysis approaches (e.g., pattern analyses, multimodal data integration, naturalistic paradigms, alignment methods &amp; statistical learning) as open, transparent and reproducible as possible. Furthermore, I’m highly invested in education &amp; outreach, fair access &amp; utilization of knowledge, as well as
responsible &amp; sustainable science.</p>
