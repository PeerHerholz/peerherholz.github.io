After realizing that I should change my teenage musician slacker lifestyle to something good and productive I started my adventure into the human mind by earning a bachelor ([University of Leipzig](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/)) and master ([Phillips-University Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en)) degree in neurolinguistics and neuropsychology, followed by a master in cognitive & integrative systems neuroscience, as well as a PhD in cognitive & computational neuroscience (both at [Phillips-University Marburg](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en) and partly [BRAMS](https://www.brams.org/en/)).

Throughout this time I was always puzzled by the same question: “how are waves transformed into sound and perceived by the human and non-human brain resulting in something incredibly powerful?”, defining also my current postdoctoral research interest and work investigating the neurobiology of music via open and reproducible auditory neuroscience. Starting from simple tones and the structure of the auditory system to complex melodies and rhythms and the representation of music genres features, I’m interested in the influence of cortical development, as well as plasticity and how music related brain activation can be explained via computational and conceptual models.

Starting in my masters I furthermore developed a major crush on everything related to analyses and methods within the realm of neuroinformatics, as well as open & reproducible (neuro)science. Most of the time I’m trying to combine all of the above organizing and conducting workshops, hackathons and lectures/talks, supvervising students and trying to establishing/pushing standards across different levels (lab, institute, university, etc.) by being part of the most amazing community that there is.

I aim to make everything I do as open and transparent as possible, no matter if research, teaching, etc. . The different aspects and respective outcomes can be found on the following platforms:
