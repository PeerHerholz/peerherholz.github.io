      <description>Ahoi hoi there and welcome to my website. My name is Peer and I&amp;rsquo;m currently a postdoctoral researcher
in cognitive and computational auditory neuroscience partly affiliated with the Montréal Neurological Institute &amp;amp; Hospital (MNI) located at McGill University &amp;amp; with the International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS) which is jointly run by the Université de Montréal &amp;amp; McGill University.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how human and non-human brains, as well as machines process sounds, especially music, which I mainly investigate using fMRI and pattern analyses/computational approaches, but more and more also aided by EEG and behavior.</description>
