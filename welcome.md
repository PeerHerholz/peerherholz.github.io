Ahoi hoi there and welcome to my website. My name is Peer and I’m currently  I’m currently a self-employed freelancer/contractor and on the side a research affiliate in cognitive and computational (auditory) neuroscience \& AI partly affiliated with the [Montréal Neurological Institute & Hospital (MNI)](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) located at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), with the [International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS)](https://www.brams.org/en/) which is jointly run by the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) & [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) & [Senseable Intelligence Group](https://sensein.group/) at the [McGovern Institute for Brain Research](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/). Additionally, I’m also part of the [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [Neuromod](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) and [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/) team.

Do you have a challenging problem in the realm of neuroscience to tackle, including data acquisition, management, analyzses and reporting? You additionally would be interested in open & reproducible workflows, including standardization and version control? You are interested in workshops around data/project management, programming/computational environments, neuroimaging analyses via a diverse set of methods, including artificial intelligence? Please don't hesitate to contact me via one of the options outlined on the left and I'm more than happy to evaluate how I could be of help. 

In terms of research, I’m interested in generalization in biological and artificial agents and the potentially underlying transformations as a basis for intelligent adaptive behavior. I tackle these questions using MRI, EEG, behavior and artificial neural networks, with a special emphasis on data analysis approaches (e.g., pattern analyses, multimodal data integration, naturalistic paradigms, alignment methods & statistical learning) as open, transparent and reproducible as possible. Furthermore, I’m highly invested in education & outreach, fair access & utilization of knowledge, as well as
responsible & sustainable science.

For everything else that is currently going and/or I'm interested you can check my Twitter feed below:
