Ahoi hoi there and welcome to my website! 

My name is Peer and I’m a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University and a research affiliate in cognitive
and computational (auditory) neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analyses, partly affiliated with the [Montréal Neurological Institute & Hospital (MNI)](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) located at[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), with the [International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research (BRAMS)](https://www.brams.org/en/) which is jointly run by the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience](https://hebartlab.com/) lab at the [Max-Planck-Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Science](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/en). 

Additionally, I’m also part of the [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [Neuromod](https://www.cneuromod.ca/), [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/) and the [European AI Alliance](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-ai-alliance) team.

In terms of research, I’m interested in generalization in biological and artificial agents and the potentially underlying transformations as a basis for intelligent adaptive behavior. I tackle these questions using MRI, EEG, behavior and artificial neural networks, with a special emphasis on data analysis approaches (e.g., pattern analyses, multimodal data integration, naturalistic paradigms, alignment methods & statistical learning) as open, transparent and reproducible as possible. Furthermore, I’m highly invested in education & outreach, fair access & utilization of knowledge, as well as responsible & sustainable science.

For everything else that is currently going and/or I'm interested in, you can check my Bluesky fee [here](https://bsky.app/profile/peerherholz.bsky.social).
